Campus Energy Dashboard- Tracks and visualize electricity usage across campus buildings in a simple and interactive way! This Python project loads CSV meter data, analyzes consumption, and creates a clear dashboard.

How It Works:

1. Loads all CSV files from the DATA folder and combines them

2. Organizes readings by building using classes (Building, MeterReading)

3. Calculates daily and weekly totals, and building-wise statistics

4. Generates plots: daily line chart, weekly bar chart, scatter of all readings

5. Saves cleaned data, building summary, and a text report highlighting total consumption and peak usage

Features:

1. Daily & weekly energy analysis

2. Building-wise summary (total, average, min, max)

3. Visual dashboard saved as dashboard.png

4. Reports saved as CSV and text files

Requirements:

1. Python 3.x

2. pandas, matplotlib
